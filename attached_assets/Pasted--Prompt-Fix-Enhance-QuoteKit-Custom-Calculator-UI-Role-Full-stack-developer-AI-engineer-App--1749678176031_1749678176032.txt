🔧 Prompt: Fix + Enhance QuoteKit Custom Calculator UI
Role: Full-stack developer / AI engineer
App context: QuoteKit is a live quote calculator builder for service businesses, running on Replit. Core components (field builder, multi-step UI, embedded metrics) are already in place, but key features are broken or underdeveloped.

🛠️ Your Tasks:
1. 🔁 Fix Broken Live Preview Panel
Enable full scroll and interactivity inside the calculator preview modal (/dashboard).

Users must be able to:

Scroll through all 4 calculator steps (Package, Location, Details, Contact).

See real-time updates as they customize labels, prices, and steps.

Preview logic and pricing summaries before publishing.

Preview should feel like a sandboxed experience of the embedded calculator.

2. ⚙️ Activate & Expand Customization Controls
Fix and extend the calculator editor so users can:

Edit step names, field labels, option prices, currency

Update headline + subheadings

Control colors, font, button styles

Save config in a structured schema (calculatorConfig.json or DB model)

Link this config to each user’s instance of the calculator (persistent settings)

3. 🧠 Restore AI Field Mutation Logic (Clone-aware Injection)
Each calculator should mutate based on use-case:

e.g. Wedding = “Coverage Hours”, “Locations”, “Add-ons”

e.g. Hair Salon = “Style Type”, “Duration”, “Stylist Preference”

The current builder doesn’t reflect the logic of its own field labels.

Use either:

AI prompt + OpenAI API to inject fields from category

Or static templates that load by service type (wedding, beauty, repair, etc.)

4. 📊 Fix Metrics: Quotes & Conversion
Current quote stats show 0 or placeholder.

Connect backend to:

Track quotes per calculator ID

Track conversion rate (optional: define by lead capture or “Check My Date” CTA click)

Auto-update stats in the dashboard

Fallbacks: display “--” or “Not enough data” when <10 quotes submitted.

5. 📤 Improve Embed + Deployment Options
On publish, generate:

Public URL for each calculator

Iframe/script embed code snippet

Optional: webhook field or Zapier-compatible integration for quote submissions

6. 🧠 [Optional Enhancement] Add AI Onboarding Assistant
(If not already included)

Ask user about:

Their business type, typical services, regions covered

Price range and availability

Auto-fill a starter template from that info

✨ Extras / Consider:
Add loading spinners or progress indicators in preview mode

Warn users if steps are incomplete (e.g. “Missing pricing on Step 2”)

Auto-generate calculator titles from business name and category

Provide test data mode (“simulate 10 quotes”)

✅ Outcome:
A fully working, AI-assisted quote calculator builder where users can:

See live changes as they edit

Offer context-specific quotes

Track performance

Embed the calculator anywhere
