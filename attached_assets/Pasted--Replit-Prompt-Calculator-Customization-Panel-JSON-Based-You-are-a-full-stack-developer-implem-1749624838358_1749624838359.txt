🛠️ Replit Prompt: Calculator Customization Panel (JSON-Based)
You are a full-stack developer implementing a dynamic customization feature for QuoteKit users. Each user has access to one or more AI-powered quote calculators. These calculators are embeddable widgets (iframe or JS) and are controlled via a JSON config file.

Currently, the “Customize” button in the dashboard is inactive. Your task is to make it fully functional.

🎯 GOAL:
Build a full-featured customization panel that:

Allows users to visually style their calculators

Updates and saves a JSON config file per calculator

Reflects changes live in the embedded widget preview

Is easy for non-technical users to use

Offers "Restore Defaults" and "Save Changes" options

🧩 FEATURES TO INCLUDE:
1. 🎨 Styling Customization
Primary Brand Color (hex input or color picker)

Accent Color (for highlights, buttons)

Font Family (dropdown: Sans, Serif, Rounded, System)

Font Size (Small / Medium / Large)

Rounded Corners (0px, 6px, 12px, 24px)

Button Style:

Fill / Outline / Ghost

Border radius slider

Background Type:

Solid color

Gradient

Light/dark mode toggle

2. 🖼️ Logo & Imagery
Upload Clinic or Business Logo

Upload Background Image (optional)

Header image or icon toggle

3. ✍️ Text & Content Customization
Custom Headline (e.g. “Get Your Free Estimate”)

Subheading / Description Text

Button Text ("Get My Quote", "See My Price", etc.)

Footer Note (e.g. "*Prices are estimates only.")

4. 🛠️ Functional Controls
Hide/show email capture

Toggle quote lock timer

Enable PDF download toggle

Set CTA Button URL (booking link or contact form)

5. 🌍 Language Settings
Choose interface language (EN, DE, ES, FR)

Custom label overrides for any text field (via JSON editor or UI)

6. 📦 Data Structure
Each calculator should reference a JSON config file stored in Supabase (or Firebase):

json

{
  "branding": {
    "primaryColor": "#38bdf8",
    "accentColor": "#facc15",
    "fontFamily": "sans-serif",
    "fontSize": "medium",
    "roundedCorners": 12
  },
  "appearance": {
    "background": "gradient",
    "darkMode": true,
    "logoUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/logo.png",
    "backgroundImage": ""
  },
  "text": {
    "headline": "Get Your Free Estimate",
    "subheading": "Just answer a few quick questions",
    "ctaText": "Calculate Now",
    "footerNote": "*All quotes are subject to confirmation."
  },
  "functionality": {

“Save & Apply” = write config JSON to user’s calculator instance

“Restore Default” = reset JSON to factory version

Auto-reload embedded calculator preview after save

Tooltip help for each field (e.g. “Primary color is used for buttons and highlights”)

📦 TECH STACK:
React + Tailwind CSS

JSON logic manager

Supabase or Firebase for user-specific calculator config storage

Optional: Live calculator preview via iframe refresh on save

Optional: Upload endpoints for logo/bg images (via Supabase storage)

✅ OUTCOME:
The Customize button in the QuoteKit dashboard will:

Open a modal or full-page editor

Allow users to update branding, colors, content, functionality

Save all changes via JSON

Instantly preview updates

Export/share embed-ready calculator with their custom style
