Below is a hands-on SEO blueprint for QuoteKits / TogNinja that you can hand straight to your content & dev teams.
It’s broken into nine action blocks so you can cherry-pick or run it end-to-end.

1. Market snapshot
Demand for “AI quote generators” and “instant price calculators” has spiked over the last 12 months, thanks to low-code widgets like Involve.me and Elfsight, plus high-profile launches (e.g. Oracle adding quote-bot features in NetSuite).

Rule of thumb: Hit a primary term in title/H1/slug + 2–3 times in body. Blend secondaries/long-tails naturally in sub-heads.

3. Topic clusters & pillar pages
Pillar page (H1)	Why it matters	Supporting cluster articles
AI Quote Generator: How It Works & Why It Beats Spreadsheets	Core explainer + “buy” page	• “5 Industries Winning With Instant Quotes” • “Calculator vs. Webform: Conversion Showdown”

Each pillar should internally link to /features, /pricing, /demo, plus any live calculator demos.

4. On-page optimisation checklist
Element	Rule
Title tag	≤ 60 chars, primary keyphrase first (“AI Quote Generator
Slug	kebab-case, primary term (“/ai-quote-generator”)
H1	Mirrors title but human-friendly
Intro (first 100 words)	Repeat primary term once, add emotional hook
One H2	Must contain primary or synonym
Meta description	120–156 chars, KPI + CTA + primary term
Image SEO	File-name: ai-quote-calculator-demo.png • Alt text ≤ 125 chars including keyphrase
Internal links	At least 3 (features, pricing, demo)
External	1–2 authority links (e.g. HubSpot calculator study, Stripe docs)

5. Technical & LLM optimisation
Schema: SoftwareApplication, FAQPage, and per-calculator Product schema.

Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5 s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100 ms.

FAQ blocks: Add collapsible Q&A to each pillar (feeds Google & LLMs).

Robots / XML sitemap: Re-generate weekly; include new calculators.

Alt-text discipline: Helps vision-enabled LLMs understand context.

6. Image & media blueprint
Asset	Purpose	Alt-text formula
Calculator GIF	Show real-time quote generation	“Live demo of AI quote generator producing cost estimate”
Industry mock-ups	Build trust	“Wedding photography price calculator on smartphone”
Infographic	Summarise benefits	“Steps to embed AI price estimator on website”

Compress with AVIF/WebP; lazy-load below the fold.

7. Authority & link-building
Integrations outreach – guest posts on no-code blogs (Makerpad, NoCodeDevs).
