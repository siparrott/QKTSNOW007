üß† Replit Prompt: Authentication, Subscription & Embeddable Calculator Instance System for QuoteKit.ai
You are a full-stack engineer building the backend logic and user flow for QuoteKit.ai, a SaaS platform offering embeddable quote calculators for over 50 service-based industries.

Build the infrastructure that allows users to:

Register/Login securely

Purchase a subscription tier

Receive a custom hosted copy of their calculator (isolated per user)

Access a private Admin Panel to customize it

Get an email with an embed script for their website

Track their quote usage per month

‚öôÔ∏è TECH STACK:
Frontend: React (Replit-hosted frontend UI already built)

Backend: Supabase (auth, DB, storage), Stripe (subscriptions)

Deployment: Replit + custom subdomains (e.g., userX.quotekit.ai/calculator-type)

Email: Resend / SendGrid / Supabase functions

Admin Panel: Hosted on secure subdirectory (e.g., quotekit.ai/admin/userX)
