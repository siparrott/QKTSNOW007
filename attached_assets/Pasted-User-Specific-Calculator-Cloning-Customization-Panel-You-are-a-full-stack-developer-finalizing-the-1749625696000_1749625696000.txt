User-Specific Calculator Cloning & Customization Panel
You are a full-stack developer finalizing the customization system for QuoteKit. The current interface shows a generic version of the calculator. We now need to implement true user-specific calculator instancing ‚Äî where each selected calculator is cloned and uniquely editable.

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
When a user selects a calculator and clicks Customize, they should:

Be editing their own cloned copy of that calculator (with full quote logic + inputs)

See a live preview of their version, not the generic template

Have full control over logo, fonts, style, service variables, and text

Save those changes to their personal database record for that calculator

Be able to embed their customized version on their site using a unique URL

üîÑ REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY:
‚úÖ 1. Clone Calculator on Selection
On user click (e.g. ‚ÄúAdd to My Dashboard‚Äù), create a copy of the selected calculator in the database

This copy includes:

Full form structure

Pricing logic

Default styles

Calculator type ID (for internal reference)

‚úÖ 2. Bind Customize Panel to Cloned Instance
When user clicks Customize, fetch their copy (by calculator ID + user ID)

Load their saved styles, service variables, pricing logic

Allow full editing of:

Texts (headline, subheading, CTA, footnote)

Pricing tiers + logic (JSON block)

Question labels + dropdown options

Visibility toggles (email capture, PDF export, etc.)

‚úÖ 3. Enable Logo Upload
Add logo upload field (image preview + delete option)

Store uploaded file to Supabase/Firebase Storage

Auto-attach logo URL to user's calculator config JSON

Display logo in top left of calculator preview panel

‚úÖ 4. Add Full Font Library
Replace current dropdown with extended Google Fonts (or similar), e.g.:

js
Copy
Edit
[
  "Inter", "Lato", "Montserrat", "Playfair Display", "Poppins", "Roboto", "Roboto Slab",
  "Open Sans", "Source Sans Pro", "Merriweather", "Raleway", "Oswald", "Nunito", "DM Sans",
  "Quicksand", "Work Sans", "Abril Fatface", "Mulish", "Libre Baskerville", "Cormorant Garamond"
]
Apply font family to live preview instantly

Save selected font in calculator config JSON

‚úÖ 5. Live Preview = Real Quote Calculator
Replace static iframe with live instanced preview of user‚Äôs own calculator

Reflect current question inputs, logic, and style changes instantly

Ensure quote calculator pulls logic + labels from current state config

üß† DATA MODEL RECOMMENDATION:
Each user-calculator instance should store:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "calculatorId": "wedding-photography",
  "instanceId": "calc_abc123",
  "branding": {
    "primaryColor": "#3b82f6",
    "accentColor": "#facc15",
    "fontFamily": "Poppins",
    "roundedCorners": 12,
    "logoUrl": "https://cdn.supabase.com/user123/logo.png"
  },
  "text": {
    "headline": "Get Your Wedding Quote",
    "subheading": "Tell us about your special day",
    "ctaText": "See My Price",
    "footerNote": "*Final pricing depends on confirmation."
  },
  "quoteLogic": {
    "baseRate": 1200,
    "addOns": { ... },
    "discounts": { ... }
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "label": "Event Duration",
      "type": "dropdown",
      "options": ["Half Day", "Full Day", "Two Days"]
    },
    {
      "label": "Number of Guests",
      "type": "number"
    }
  ]
}
üß™ OPTIONAL: Advanced Improvements
Save/Undo revision system (store last 3 versions)

Preview on multiple devices (mobile/tablet switch)

‚ÄúReset to Template Defaults‚Äù button

Option to duplicate an existing customized calculator

üì¶ FINAL OUTCOME:
Each user can fully brand, configure, and embed their own private calculator clone

All UI controls are stored in and read from their instance JSON

All previews and embeds reflect their actual quote logic and styles

You now have the ability to monetize each customized instance independently
