## System Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Wouter (routing), shadcn/ui (components), Tailwind CSS (styling), Framer Motion (animations), Tanstack Query (server state), Vite (build).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), OpenAI GPT-4o (NLP), Stripe (payments), JWT (authentication), Nodemailer (email).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless), Supabase (additional ops), Drizzle Kit (migrations).

### Key Features & Design Patterns
- **AI Processing Engine**: Specialized AI processors (e.g., for car wash, dental, childcare) extract pricing parameters from natural language input using structured prompts.
- **Calculator System**: Supports `Template Calculators` (master templates) and `User Calculators` (user-owned instances). Calculators are configured via `layout_json` (UI), `logic_json` (pricing), `style_json` (branding), and `prompt_md` (AI instructions).
- **Dynamic Pricing Architecture**: Standardized system using `getXXXPricing()` functions with `customConfig` fallback to defaults. Supports dynamic currency symbols (‚Ç¨, $, ¬£, CHF, C$, A$) and real-time preview updates. Components include base price, durations, locations, add-ons, and delivery options.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with secure session management, two-factor authentication, and role-based access control integrated with Stripe for subscription tiers.
- **Subscription System**: Three-tier model (Free, Pro, Business, Enterprise) offering varying features and quotas.
- **Data Flow**:
    - **Quote Generation**: User input -> AI processing -> structured data extraction -> pricing calculation -> quote generation -> lead capture -> email notifications.
    - **Calculator Embedding**: User creates calculator -> unique embed URL -> embed code for website integration -> responsive iframe rendering -> quote tracking.
    - **User Onboarding**: Account registration -> email verification -> calculator selection -> configuration -> embed code generation -> analytics activation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Utilizes shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. Framer Motion for animations. Customizable color schemes and templates via `style_json`. Inline editing functionality (EditableText) for calculator content.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implemented dynamic meta tag management via SEO Head component, server-side SEO routes (sitemap.xml, robots.txt), structured data (JSON-LD), Open Graph, and Twitter Card optimization.
